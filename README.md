How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs is essential for long-term success in software development. To achieve this, developers should follow principles such as modularity, descriptive naming, documentation, consistent formatting, error handling, testing, version control, and code reviews. By using a CRUD Python module to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two, several advantages were realized. Firstly, the code became more reusable as the CRUD module abstracted away the details of database interaction, allowing for easy reuse across multiple projects or components. Secondly, the separation of concerns improved code readability and maintainability, as developers could focus on building the dashboard interface without worrying about low-level database operations. Lastly, this approach offered flexibility, enabling future adaptation to changes in the database schema or underlying technology stack without impacting the dashboard code. Moving forward, the CRUD module could be leveraged in various other projects or components requiring interaction with the same database, thus promoting code reuse and facilitating development efficiency.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Approaching a problem as a computer scientist involves understanding requirements, decomposing the problem, conducting research, designing a solution, implementing it, testing, and communicating effectively. For the database and dashboard requirements requested by Grazioso Salvare, this approach entailed understanding their needs, analyzing data sources, selecting appropriate technologies, and iteratively developing and refining the solution based on feedback. Compared to theoretical assignments in other courses, this project emphasized real-world application, collaboration with stakeholders, and integration of multiple technologies. In the future, to meet other client requests for databases, I would conduct thorough requirements analysis, design an appropriate database schema, select a suitable database management system, implement best practices for database design and security, provide user-friendly interfaces, test rigorously, and provide documentation and training for effective utilization.
